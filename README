SO-666 v.1.01 by 50m30n3 2009-2010

SO-666 is a feedback based drone synthesizer building upon the SO-KL5 synth.
It creates haunting cacophonic howls and drones.
It's a bit hard to play but making good use of the modwheel will help keep the
sound in control.

To run the synth you need Jack and ALSA. You can set a different midi channel
by starting the program using the channel number as argument. The default
channel is zero.

All synthesis parameters can be edited using MIDI CC messages.

Parameter list:
CC#1	-	Feedback (mod wheel)
CC#7	-	Volume
CC#71	-	Filter Resonance
CC#74	-	Filter Cutoff

To compile the code you need the ALSA and Jack developement files.
